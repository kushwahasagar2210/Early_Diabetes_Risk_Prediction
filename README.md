# Early Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- SHAP-based model explainability
- Trained model files (`best_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`)

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Load the model and make predictions using the notebook or app.py
